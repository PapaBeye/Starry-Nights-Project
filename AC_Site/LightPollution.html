    <p id="para1">The inappropriate or excessive use of artificial light – known as light pollution – can have serious environmental
        consequences for humans, wildlife, and our climate. Components of light pollution include:</p>

    <h1 id="h2">How Bad is Light Pollution?</h1>
    <p>With much of the Earth’s population living under light-polluted skies, over lighting is an international concern.
        If you live in an urban or suburban area all you have to do to see this type of pollution is go outside at night and look up at the sky.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>According to the 2016 groundbreaking &#8220;World Atlas of Artificial Night Sky Brightness &#8221; 80 percent of the world&#8217;s
        population lives under skyglow. In the United States and Europe 99 percent of the public can&#8217;t experience a natural night!</p>

    <h1 id="h3">Effects of Light Pollution</h1>
    <p style="text-int">For three billion years, life on Earth existed in a rhythm of light and dark that was created
        solely by the illumination of the Sun, Moon and stars. Now, artificial lights overpower the darkness and our cities glow at night,
        disrupting the natural day-night pattern and shifting the delicate balance of our environment. The negative effects of the loss of this
        inspirational natural resource might seem intangible. But a growing body of evidence links the brightening night sky directly to measurable
        negative impacts including</p>

    <br>
    <ul id="nul">
        <li>Increasing energy consumption</li>
        <br>
        <li>Disrupting the ecosystem and wildlife</li>
        <br>
        <li>Harming human health</li>
        <br>
        <li>Effecting crime and safety</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Light pollution affects every citizen. Fortunately, concern about light pollution is rising dramatically. A growing number of scientists,
        homeowners, environmental groups and civic leaders are taking action to restore the natural night. Each of us can implement practical solutions
        to combat light pollution locally, nationally and internationally.</p>
    <h3>You Can Help!</h3>
    <p>The good news is that light pollution, unlike many other forms of pollution, is reversible and each one of us can make a difference!
        Just being aware that light pollution is a problem is not enough; the need is for action. You can start by minimizing the light from
        your own home at night. You can do this by following these simple steps.</p>
    <br>
    <ul id="nul2">
        <li>Only use lighting when and where it&#8217;s needed</li>
        <br>
        <li>If safety is concern, install motion detector lights and timers</li>
        <br>
        <li>Properly shield all outdoor lights</li>
        <br>
        <li>Keep your blinds drawn to keep light inside</li>
        <br>
        <li>Spread the word to your family and friends and tell them to pass it on. Many people either don&#8217;t know or don&#8217;t
    understand a lot about light pollution and the negative impacts of artificial light at night. By being an ambassador and
    explaining the issues to others you will help bring awareness to this growing problem and inspire more people to take the necessary
    steps to protect our natural night sky. </li>
