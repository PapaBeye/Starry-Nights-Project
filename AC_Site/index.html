		<p id="para1" style="position: relative; left:150px; color:white">Less than 100 years ago, everyone could look up and see a spectacular starry night sky. Now,
			millions of children across the globe will never experience the Milky Way where they live. The increased and widespread
			use of artificial light at night is not only impairing our view of the universe, it is adversely affecting our environment,
			our safety, our energy consumption and our health.Solutions to light pollution have been created, but many people are not aware of them.
			Our goal as a team is to bring awareness to light pollution and present solutions through an interactive social media campaign.
			We want to help build the bridge between the past and the future by implementing new technologies to reveal the skies of our ancestors
			and ultimately improve people’s health and foster people’s connections to nature and each other. So while the eco-friendly markets boomed
			with the advent of social media and smartphones, the issue of light pollution has been left in 1988 with the formation of the International
			Dark-Association. Our company will modernize the IDA’s original mission to reduce light pollution through an online, interactive, social-media
			campaign.</p>
